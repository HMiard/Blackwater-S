a simple, easy to use GUI, allowing the user to quickly create, manage and scale
websockets PHP servers.

Generated Blackwater projects are based on **Blackwater-P**, a side-project
available from packagist (<https://packagist.org/packages/blackwater/blackwaterp>).
Blackwater-P extends basic Ratchet/WAMP based servers, allowing a persistent
database connection availability and wrapping some useful methods.

In order to use Blackwater-S, you will need PHP (>5.3.9) accessible
from a terminal, and a connection to a database of your choice
(MySQL by default).

See Ratchet at <http://socketo.me/>

Building from source
==============

In order to build Blackwater-S, install Apache Ant and run "ant" in the root of
the cloned local repository.

Building Blackwater-S from source will result in a folder containing
resources and the bootstrap jar. Java 1.8.0_25 at least is needed,
or you will need to adapt the source-code.
